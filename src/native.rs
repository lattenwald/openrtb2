/// 3.2.9 Object: Native
///
/// This object represents a native type impression. Native ad units are intended to blend
/// seamlessly into the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter or Facebook post). As such,
/// the response must be well-structured to afford the publisher fine-grained control over
/// rendering.
///
/// The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB called the Dynamic
/// Native Ads API. It defines the request parameters and response markup structure of native ad
/// units. This object provides the means of transporting request parameters as an opaque string so
/// that the specific parameters can evolve separately under the auspices of the Dynamic Native Ads
/// API. Similarly, the ad markup served will be structured according to that specification.
///
/// The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is
/// offered as a native type impression. At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may
/// also be offered as banner, video, and/or audio by also including as Imp subordinates objects of
/// those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
